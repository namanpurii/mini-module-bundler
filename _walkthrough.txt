Implementation Overview:
    1. Parse a single file and extract its dependencies
    2. Recursively build a dependency graph
    3. Package everything into a single file.

We have taken a simple example in our src directory:
    - Where index.js has single dependency from message.js and, message.js has single 
    dependency from name.js
    - bundle.js file in the root directory is the output file; as a result of bundling 
    dependencies from all the files in the src directory.
